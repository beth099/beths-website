I am a psychology PhD student at [**the University of Melbourne**](https://unimelb.edu.au) studying research practices and science communication in social and personality psychology. I am also part of the [**MetaMelb Research Group**](https://Metamelb.org) and a Research Assistant on [**the repliCATS project**](https://replicats.research.unimelb.edu.au/#tabmain), investigating how reviewers evaluate published papers. After completing my Bachelor of Arts (Hons) in 2021, my combined interest in philosophy and psychology has led me to pursue research in metascience.
