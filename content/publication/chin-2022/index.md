abstract: 'The rules and procedures regulating the admission of potentially unreliable
  expert evidence have been substantially weakened over the past several years. We
  respond to this trend by focusing on one aspect of the rules that has not been explicitly
  curtailed: unfair prejudice. Unfair prejudice is an important component of trial
  judges’ authority to exclude evidence, which they may do when that unfair prejudice
  outweighs the evidence’s probative value. We develop the concept of unfair prejudice
  by first examining how it has been interpreted by judges and then relating that
  to the relevant social scientific research on the characteristics of expertise that
  can make it prejudicial. In doing so, we also discuss the research behind a common
  reason that judges admit expert evidence despite its prejudice, which is that judicial
  directions help jurors understand and weigh it. As a result, this article provides
  two main contributions. First, it advances knowledge about unfair prejudice, which
  is an important part of expert evidence law that has received relatively little
  attention from legal researchers. Second, it provides guidance to practitioners
  for challenging expert evidence under one of the few avenues left to do so.'
